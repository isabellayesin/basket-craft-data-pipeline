This project demonstrates the complete development of a modern analytics pipeline, integrating multiple tools and technologies from data extraction to dashboard visualization. Raw data is first extracted from an AWS RDS MySQL database using Python and Pandas, then loaded into a raw schema in AWS RDS Postgres using SQLAlchemy. dbt is used to transform the data through structured staging and warehouse layers, creating clean, analysis-ready models. GitHub Codespaces provides the development environment, while GitHub Actions and Secrets are used for automated deployment and secure credential management. The final fact and dimension tables feed into a Looker Studio dashboard for visualization. Version control is maintained through Git and GitHub. This repository contains lesson exercises, dbt models, and a full ELT workflow that showcases data flowing from source to insights.
